#Django-Admin is a utility that comes with django
django-admin

#From this utility, we want to use the one called: startproject followed by the name of the project:
django-admin startproject storefront

#Instead of doing a new folder, we can also do it in the curent folder:
django-admin startproject .

#Open the file manage.py using python command. You will see that it has some commands as well.
python manage.py

#To run the server use:
python manage.py runserver

#By default will use something like the local host (127.0.0.1) and port 8000.
#Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK. (Windows)
#Lets try to open it in port 8080:
python manage.py runserver 8080 

# easy...

#Stop the server by just killing the window again with Ctrl + C or command in Mac...
#Lets go and open our enviroment in Visual Studio Code now.


#Open the folder where you created the project and type to show the path of the enviroment:
pipenv --venv

Ctrl Shift + P to select the Interpreter.
Enter the path of the interpreter.
